# How to Make an Executable as an Image (or Word, MP3, etc.)

To create an executable file that appears as an image (or a Word document, music file, etc.), we will use WinRAR. Follow these steps:

## Requirements
- WinRAR installed on your computer.

## Steps

1. Select Files: Choose the image (or Word, music file, etc.) and the executable file.
2. Add to Archive: Right-click the selected files and choose `WinRAR > Add to archive...`.
3. Rename Archive: Change the archive name if desired.
4. Create SFX Archive: Check the option `Create SFX archive`.
5. SFX Options:
    - Go to the `Advanced` tab and click `SFX options...`.
    - Under the `Setup` tab, in the `Run after extraction` field, enter the name of the image file (e.g., `image.jpg`), press Enter, and then enter the name of the executable file (e.g., `program.exe`).
6. Modes:
    - Go to the `Modes` tab.
    - Check `Unpack to temporary folder`.
    - Select `Hide all`.
